# The Closet by Brenda Garlow
## IASC-1P04 

The Closet is a short adventure game where the players go through a secret door inside the closet. They become trapped inside with a disembodied spirit who may be a friend or a foe. Players must find the ingredients for, and activate, a spell that will release them. Inspired by Brenda Garlow's childhood dream/nightmare. The Closet conveys the idea that putting blind faith in strangers is never a better idea than checking the facts yourself.
